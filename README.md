# Riddle-Me-This
## A Flask milestone project for Practical Python
### Part of the Fullstack Web Developer Course - Code Institute

This project is deployed at []().  
Github Repository is at [riddle-game-app](https://github.com/abonello/riddle-game-app).

#### Install Flask
~~~~
sudo pip3 install flask
~~~~

#### Prepare requirements file
This will be needed for the Heroku deployment.
~~~~
sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
~~~~
**requirements.txt** file will allow anybody else who is cloning this 
repository to install all requirements.  
Note that while install Flask, it will install its own requirements as well.

#### Prepare the Procfile
This will be needed for the Heroku deployment.
~~~~
echo web: python run.py > Procfile
~~~~

#### Create the run.py
This is the application file.
~~~~
touch run.py
~~~~

#### Wireframe
I am using Pencil for wireframing this app.  
I uploaded the files as at 15/03/18 14:44  
These files were pulled to Cloud9.

#### Adding file place holders
I added:  
* users.txt in /data  
* styles.css in /static/css  
* index.html in /templates  

#### Fundamental imports in run.py
~~~~python
import os
from flask import Flask
~~~~

#### create flask application
~~~~python
app = Flask(__name__)
~~~~

#### create first route for ROOT:
~~~~python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
~~~~

#### Prepare the app to run
~~~~python
app.run(host=os.getenv('IP'), port=int(os.getenv('PORT')), debug=True)
~~~~
It will get the IP address and the PORT. It also sets debug to True which is 
very handy when developing an app as the server will be restarted automatically
after saving a file.

#### Manual Testing
Run run.py to check that setup and flask are OK.  
Everything working.

#### Added more routes -- About, Contact, Hall-of-Fame
All manually tested and working.

#### Added simple templates for About, Contact, Hall-of-Fame
All manually tested and working.

#### Current routing
~~~~python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # return "<h1>Hello World -- This is Riddle-Me-This Application</h1><h2>It is a guessing game.</h2>"
    return render_template("index.html")
    
@app.route('/halloffame')
def halloffame():
    # return "<h1>Riddle-Me-This Application</h1><h2>Hall of Fame</h2>"
    return render_template("halloffame.html")
    
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    # return "<h1>Riddle-Me-This Application</h1><h2>About</h2>"
    return render_template("about.html")
    
@app.route('/contact')
def contact():
    # return "<h1>Riddle-Me-This Application</h1><h2>Contact</h2>"
    return render_template("contact.html")
~~~~

Note to self: Will be cleaning code later.

#### Catch up note

18/3/18


Over the past few days I experimented with various html and css code to find
how I am going to lay things down while keeping to the wireframe I prepared.
I explored how the menu will respond to different screen sizes. I want the menu
to be a button at the top for mobiles. It becomes a menu across the top for 
tablets and then a menu below the main title for larger screens.

I managed to achieve this.

I also explored various colors and visual details such as borders. Now I think 
that I am in a position to start laying down the foundation for the index page.
I will start by writing the whole html and css code which I will later refactor
in a way as to use a base template which will be extended in the other templates.

* * *
#### Draft Index.html Template

I finished the responsive draft for the **index.html** template together with 
the accompanying styles.css  
NB:
1. The current colour scheme is only tentative at this stage.
2. The logo image is a place holder. It might be changed later on.

I used Chrome extensively to develope the CSS using the automatic features that
this browser offers to display changes in real time. I also found it handy when
setting colors.

I will think about what fonts to use before proceeding to the next step.

Next I will draft **about.html**, **contact.html** and **halloffame.html** based on the 
same code.

#### Manual testing of draft for index.html
The draft up to this point was manually tested to make sure that the layout
is fully responsive. I used Chrome for this.

#### Selecting Google Fonts

##### Main Title:  short list
|||
|--|--|
|**Gloria Hallelujah**|Schoolbell|
|Courgette|Kalam|
|Merienda|

##### Sub Titles:
Bubblegum Sans

##### Text: short list
|||
|-|-|
|***Forum***|Comfortaa|
|***Kelly Slab***|**Averia Serif Libre**|

##### Selected fonts

Main Title : Gloria Hallelujah  
Sub Titles : Bubblegum Sans  
Other Text : Averia Serif Libre

Changed h2 in main section to h3. Better semantics.


##### Apply draft code to other pages

Now I have index.html, about.html, halloffame.html and contact.html base on the
same layout and responsive design.

What I need to add is the menu for the registration and login at the top of the 
page.

I also need to try and test the deployment on heroku.

##### Bug
I noticed a bug when I tries to load the page on my mobile. There is some 
horizontal scroll of the whole page and I cannot understand what is causing it.
Also the Menu button is partly out of sight.

I rethought the layout for mobile design. I saw that the logo image was taking
too much space so I decided to remove this for mobiles and tablets. It will 
appear only in the desktop layout. Also the form for registering / login has
been moved. It will appear at the top for mobiles and tablets. Note that the 
placement is slightly different due to the Menu button for mobiles. And, it will
appear above the menu (below the titles) for the desktop layout. I think this 
gives a better user experience. I am still finding that there is some horizontal 
scrolling when testing in Chrome emulating mobiles.

Fixed: missprint in .logo margin. Was set to -50px. Now chagned to 0px.

#### Heroku Deployment
Logged in to heroku. (Need email and password) I then listed the apps I already
have. Following this I created an app with the title "riddle-guessing-game". All
this was done in the command line.
~~~~
heroku login
heroku apps
heroku apps:create riddle-guessing-game
~~~~
Once I list the heroku apps again, the new app is in the list.
Logging into heroku and creating an app will also add a git remote. This can be 
viewed by listing the git remotes.
~~~~
git remote -v
~~~~

The result of the last command is:
~~~~
    heroku  https://git.heroku.com/riddle-guessing-game.git (fetch)
    heroku  https://git.heroku.com/riddle-guessing-game.git (push)
    origin  https://github.com/abonello/riddle-game-app.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/abonello/riddle-game-app.git (push)
~~~~

Next I will push the project to heroku.
~~~~
git push -u heroku master
~~~~

Successfully installed Flask-0.12.2 Jinja2-2.10 MarkupSafe-1.0 Werkzeug-0.14.1 click-6.7 itsdangerous-0.24
https://riddle-guessing-game.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To [Riddle-Guessing-Game](https://git.heroku.com/riddle-guessing-game.git)

Create a watcher in heroku.
~~~~
heroku ps:scale web=1
~~~~

Next we need to go to the Heroku site. Select the app. From settings, click on 
*Reveal Config Vars*. Here you need to create some configuration variables.
Set the following key : value pairs
IP 0.0.0.0
PORT 5000

These will be the IP and PORT used in the following line of code in run.py
~~~~python
app.run(host=os.getenv('IP'), port=int(os.getenv('PORT')), debug=True)
~~~~

Restart all Dynos:  
Go to More in Heroku and restart all dynos.

I am getting the following error:  
at=error code=H14 desc="No web processes running" method=GET path="/favicon.ico" host=riddle-guessing-game.herokuapp.com request_id=86105bba-9b47-44f2-a211-f83b2cc3a3fa fwd="92.21.201.110" dyno= connect= service= status=503 bytes= protocol=https

I tracked this down to the following:  
When I run
~~~~
heroku ps:scale web=1
~~~~
I get the following:
*       Scaling dynos... !  
         â–¸    Couldn't find that process type.  
 

I changed this code in run.py
~~~~python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host=os.getenv('IP'), port=int(os.getenv('PORT')), debug=True)
~~~~

Then I pushed again to heroku. run the scaling and restarted the dynos.  
No errors and the app is successfully deployed.
~~~~
git push -u heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
~~~~

#### Passing a variable to index.html
~~~~html
<h2>{{ username }}</h2>
~~~~
and run.py, the @app.route('/')
~~~~python
username = "AB"
return render_template("index.html", username=username)
~~~~

This displays the hardcoded text. Now I want to capture a text written as 
username and posted using the login button.

Get two buttons to function from the same form.  

Changes to code:  
run.py  
import request is added  
modify the routing for / 
Currently I have a default username but this will be changed. It will be a list
of usernames stored in a text file. The file will be read in a set to which new
usernames can be added to make sure they are unique.
~~~~python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

@app.route('/', methods=['GET','POST'])
def index():
    username = "AB"
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'register' in request.form:
            username = request.form['username']
        elif 'login' in request.form:
            username = "Please register first"
        
    return render_template("index.html", username=username)
~~~~

index.html 
POST method was added to the form and an action. names were added to each form 
part.  
~~~~html
<form class="align-right" method="POST" action="/">
    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" class="form-control form-username form-align" name="username" id="username" placeholder="username">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default form-align" name="login" type="submit" value="login">Login</button>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default form-align" name="register" type="submit" value="register">Register</button>
    </div>
</form>
~~~~html

* * *
Next I need to check if a username already exist when someone tries to register.  

~~~~python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET','POST'])
def index():
    username_set = {'AB', 'BC', 'CD'}
    username = ""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'register' in request.form:
            username = request.form['username']
            if username in username_set:
                username = ""
                return render_template("index.html", username="username already exist try another one")
            else:
                username_set.add(username)
                
        elif 'login' in request.form:
            username = "Please register first"
        
    return render_template("index.html", username=username, allusers=username_set)
~~~~

For now a username_set holds all the users. When someone new tries to register
the username is checked to see if it already exist in which case a text appears,
currently an h2 below the subtitle asking the user to select another name. If 
the username does not exist it is added to the set.  
I am currently displaying the contents of the set in the main section for testing 
purposes. This will be removed.

The set is reinitialised everytime the / route is selected so I cannot add two users.
Moving
~~~~python
username_set = {'AB', 'BC', 'CD'}
~~~~
outside of def index() solved this temporary problem. Now the set will hold any
added users for as long as I do not restart the server.

Login and Registration sorted.

~~~~python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET','POST'])
def index():
    allusers = ""
    username = ""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        with open("data/users.txt", "r") as readusernames:
            allusers = readusernames.read()
        if 'register' in request.form:
                if username in allusers:
                    return render_template("index.html", username="username already exist try another one")
                else:
                    with open("data/users.txt", "a") as addusernames:
                        addusernames.write(username + "\n")
                        allusers += (username)
                    return render_template("index.html", username=username, allusers=allusers)
                
        elif 'login' in request.form:
            if username == "":
                return render_template("index.html", username="Enter a username to log in", allusers=allusers)
            elif username in allusers:
                username += " LOGGED IN"
                return render_template("index.html", username=username, allusers=allusers)
            else:
                username = "That username does not exist."
            return render_template("index.html", username=username, allusers=allusers)
        
    return render_template("index.html", username=username, allusers="")
~~~~

I will now need to make the registration button redirect to another page and 
move the relevant code there.

I changed the register code in route for index.html to load the register.html  
In here I will have another form which will do the checking of a username to 
see if it already exist and the actual registration of a new username.





Added some more code in register.html and related python.
